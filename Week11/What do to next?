- Absolutely great course to attend 
- Learned 'basic' concepts of machine learning 
- Assignments were kind of easy(since this course is for all kinds of majors) 
- My purpose was to see if I can try to learn this course, in a more detailed way/
- I feel a great interest in this field, course, area. 
- However, I am not a CS or a STATS specialist
- So, my plan is to learn more in Data Science Masters track in US top universities
